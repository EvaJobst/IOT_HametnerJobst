## IoT Nice to Have
- Having code completion would really improve the experience
- Debugging
- Nice GUI, so no need to have a command line
- Helpful example codes -> e. g. in MongooseOS init.js already set up MQTT
- Toggling LEDS -> in MongooseOS with toggle(), replaces the need of setting LED ON/OFF

## UlnoIOT recap
- no code completion -> but help features
- Example codes
- MQTT support

60% is supported
