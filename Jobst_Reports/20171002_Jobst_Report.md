-------------------------------

## Who are you?
- What type of programming language?
	- Java, C#, C++, Swift

- What have you done with micro controllers?
	- During classes (Embedded Systems Programming and Medientechnik)
	- Attended class “Internet of Things” during Summer School in Finland, where a project was realized (used sensor data in order to change the environment/weather of a racing game)

- What do you already know about IoT?
	- Device gets connected with sensor/micro controller; devices get the ability to send data; ability to communicate between devices

- What are your expectations from the class?
	- Learn what is “Internet of Things” and what it isn’t


## IOT
##### What does the IoT entail?
Health Care, Wearables, Smart Home, Security

##### Data protocol
ZigBee, Wifi, Bluetooth

##### Devices
Raspberry Pi, Arduino

## TIA Movie
##### What does the IoT entail?
Manufactoring, Logistics

##### Devices
Cars, Logistics

##### What are the benefits of IoT?
- Scalability
- Profit $$$
- Communication between different devices
- Big Data Analysis


##### What are the challenges?
- Correct Hardware, correct Software, correct platform etc.
- Complexity
- Security (very vulnerable)


## DEMO TIME
##### Why is it IoT?
The project we have seen was the water-detector
- It is IOT:
	- since it deals with data -> sends data to the phone in order to contact the person
	- it needs a connection in order to send/receive the data on the phone
	- there are multiple systems collaborating
