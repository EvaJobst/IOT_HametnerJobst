## What is broken (with examples)?
- HUGE difference between prototype and release version
  - Supporting as many devices as possible with all kinds of different hardware and software
- Security
- Scalability
  - Developments of 1.000 deployed units to 100.000.000 over a couple of years possible
  - Need to consider:
    - Physical constraints: Needed hardware -> Server
    - Technology impedance mismatch: Need to consider the scalability of single devices when you put them together
    - Developer experience: Need to have developers with experience on programming systems with high scalability
- The most users use the system the more likely experience unlikely/unforseen errors/events
- Need to support devices sometimes for decades -> since users only replace them once they are broken
- Unable to anticipate evolving logical complexity
  - Code might become obsolete
  - Abandoned open source project
  - Need to anticipate rare but dangerous scenarios
- Different expectations between IT executives and business executives
- Lack of collaboration between IT and business side

### IoT Discussion

- Automation of daily life
- Easily access information
- IoT is new and difficult to develop
- 700 different possible devices for one scenario
- If you properly setup devices, you can even be woken up by a toaster.
- Personal data is saved and needs to be protected
- IoT devices can be abused (e.g. fire alarm as morning alarm)

- Example: Guy in huge company was able to control whole building
- Also: nuclear weapons can be a potential risk
	-> Additional security measures

- New jobs
- Loosing jobs
- e.g. gas station

- No system is 100% secure
- Time & Costs
- Cisco provides certifications for security mechanisms

- Is it possible to enable secure embeded systems?
- Question about waranty and legal rights?
- What happens when a malfunctioning device causes damage?

- Environmental impact?
- No argument against IoT
- Poor people are exploited anyway
- Software is expensive
