## What is broken (with examples)?
- HUGE difference between prototype and release version
  - Supporting as many devices as possible with all kinds of different hardware and software
- Security
- Scalability
  - Developments of 1.000 deployed units to 100.000.000 over a couple of years possible
  - Need to consider:
    - Physical constraints: Needed hardware -> Server
    - Technology impedance mismatch: Need to consider the scalability of single devices when you put them together
    - Developer experience: Need to have developers with experience on programming systems with high scalability
- The most users use the system the more likely experience unlikely/unforseen errors/events
- Need to support devices sometimes for decades -> since users only replace them once they are broken
- Unable to anticipate evolving logical complexity
  - Code might become obsolete
  - Abandoned open source project
  - Need to anticipate rare but dangerous scenarios
- Different expectations between IT executives and business executives
- Lack of collaboration between IT and business side

## How can it be fixed/counter measures?

## Newsworthy failures/successes
