#### What is the relation bandwidth/range/power?
- In order to reach a wide area with low power the bandwidth needs to be adjusted accordingly
- Bandwidth-Range:
  - Wifi: High Bandwidth, Low Range
  - Mobile Internet: Range of few hundred meters
  - Bluetooth: Range of few meters
  - They do not fulfill the capabilities that are necessary for IoT

#### What is the Link budget?
- Is something that will be spent over time
- Connection between a sender and a receiver
- No useable signal will be received if the Link-Budget is used up
- With LoRaWAN -> 154dB
- Budget is used when obstacles appear -> e.g. Tree

#### What is the community approach?
- The Things Network
  - An infrastructure to transfer messages between gateway and device
  - Provide a map of all available Gateway

#### What are the benefits with LORA?
- High Range, Narrow Bandwidth -> High Link Budget
- Low Power consumption
- Ideal for low power sensors
- Commercial and community approach for a network

#### LORA (After movie)
- Link Budget
  - A link budget is accounting of all of the gains and losses from the transmitter, through the medium (free space, cable, waveguide, fiber, etc.) to the receiver in a telecommunication system.
- Radio Link Budget Calculator
  - Prague -> Hagenberg: -137.1 dBm
  - Ansfelden -> Linz: -112.8 dBm
- LORA in Austria and Linz

  - 2016 first Gateway in Austria announced

  - 1 Gateway in Linz, 1 Gateway nearby Freistadt, 1 Gateway at HTL Ybbs

#### The Things Network
- What is TTN?
  - According to their Twitter TTN is "We are on a mission to build a global open #crowdsourced #InternetofThings data network, together."

- What does it stand for?
  - The Things Network
- Which problems does it solve?
  - Is a network for the IoT
- How does it solve them?
  - It uses a community to create Gateways
