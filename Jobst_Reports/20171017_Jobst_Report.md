## Problems with UlnoIOT
- Losing connection to Arduino
  - Debug -> see if someone tries to connect
  - Plug + Unplug

## Live Demo
- ulnoiot x accesspoint
- ulnoiot x mqtt_broker
  - No need to do these two statements

- Desktop interaction
  - console -> automatically try to establish the serial connection
  - cd examples/gaming/ -> joystick1
