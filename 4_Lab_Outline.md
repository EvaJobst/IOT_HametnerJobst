- Trying to get Node-RED to work
  - Node-RED was not recognized on cmd -> Installed it again
  - Installed it -> was recognized
  - Trying to access it on browser -> worked
- Trying to build a flow, which receives the MQTT messages of the Temperature Simulation and sends a Debug Message if the LED should be turned on or off. LED is turned on, once the Temperature is over 0Â°C.

- Adapt existing flow, so it replaces the [client.py](Lab_Outline/Temperature_Simulation/client.py)
