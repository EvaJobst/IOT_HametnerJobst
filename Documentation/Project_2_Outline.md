# Project 02 - Liquid Challenge

### Research
- First part:
  - Acoustic distance: Ultrasonic Sensor
  - Optical distance:
  - Weight:
  - Binary Conductive Sensing:

- Trying to connect the Ultrasonic Sensor and have it print its values
- Failed -> unable to collect data from the echo
- Found library at RIOT -> will try to use that now  
- Included library -> can't find module 'machine' of library
