- Trying to get Node-RED to work
  - Node-RED was not recognized on cmd -> Installed it again
  - Installed it -> was recognized
  - Trying to access it on browser -> worked
- Trying to build a flow, which receives the MQTT messages of the Temperature Simulation and sends a Debug Message if the LED should be turned on or off. LED is turned on, once the Temperature is over 0Â°C.

- Adapt existing flow, so it replaces the [client.py](./Lab_Outline/Temperature_Simulation/client.py) of the previous assignment

##### MongooseOS
- Fetched MongooseOS from https://mongoose-os.com/software.html
- Ran program -> Browser App was automatically opened
- Configured with plugged in Arduino, ESP8266 and current WIFI-connection
- Adapted init.js so the built-in-LED is toggled once a button has been pressed


Magda:

I tried to install MongooseOS on my Mac, but the access was denied.
