## Magdalena:
We both tried to connect us to Lora but the error message was:

>unrecognized transceiver

So we aksed the Professor to help us.

I actually had difficultis to connect mi to our Lora, as the hardware was malfunctional.

After 1 hour to connect to Lora we decided that I should use the Lora from the Professor. Here i was very unpatient but in the end I succsseded.
