## User Story:
Jon Snow is really popular and he likes to attend parties. His favorit beverage is beer. At the party he talks to his friends and likes to dance with his girlfriend Dany and so he often forgets to drink his beer. Luckily Jon attends "Mobile Computing" at FH Hagenberg and so he knows what to do.

With help from IoT he develops a special glass which notifies him if the beverage gets to warm. But it also sends a message if the glass gets empty. So he never has to drink warm beer again.

Jon Snow wants to be awaken at a spezific time. But there shouldn´t go of the alarm but the sun should wake him. Here also he uses IoT to let the blind go up at a specific preset time.

## User Scenario:
### Comfort:
#### Notification if beer gets warm:
Jon Snow likes his beer cold not warm and often he gets involved in a conversation with his friends and so he loses track of time. While he talks his beer gets warmer and warmer.

So the smart glass/stein sends a notification to his phone, warning him that his beer is warmer than 15°. Now he knows that he needs to speed up and drink his beer or get him another cooler one.

#### Notification if beer gets empty:
Jon Snow and his friend Hodor love to challenge each other and so at the Party it normally ends in, who can drink his beer the fastest.

The smart stein has a raindrop-sensor and this sensor helps to verify the winner. As the smart stein sends a notification to the owner´s phone if the stein gets empty.

#### Order new beer before finished the last:
The waiter, Varis, works in Jon Snow´s favorit pub. For his friends he had his phone linked to the smart steins. !!! So if Jon Snow´s stein empties the waiter Varis gets a notification and he is able to refill the smart stein.

#### no dreadful alarm:
After a long night of talking and dancing Jon Snow and his girlfriend Dany want to be awaken but not in the normal fashion. Both don´t like the jarring sound of the alarm but would really like to be awoken with the sun.

So Jon sets the time to be awoken and the blinds move up and they can be awoken with the sun-rays.

It also has a special feature, as Dany wants to sleep a bit longer Jon closes the blinds remotly and sets a new time to be awoken.

#### Tea:
Jon Snow not only can fill beer into the smart stein but also Tea and so he can monitor if the water has the correct temperature for his tea.
