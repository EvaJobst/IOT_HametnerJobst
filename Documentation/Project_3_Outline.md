## User Story:
Jon Snow is really popular and he likes to attend parties. His favorit beverage is beer. At the party he talks to his friends and likes to dance with his girlfriend Dany and so he often forgets to drink his beer. Luckily Jon attends "Mobile Computing" at FH Hagenberg and so he knows what to do.

With help from IoT he develops a special glass which notifies him if the beverage gets to warm. But it also sends a message if the glass gets empty. So he never has to drink warm beer again.

Jon Snow wants to be awaken at a spezific time. But there shouldn´t go of the alarm but the sun should wake him. Here also he uses IoT to let the blind go up at a specific preset time.

## User Scenario:
### Comfort:
- Notification as beer gets too warm
- Notification if beer is empty and your are too drunk to notify

  - so you wont be grumpy right after a good nights sleep
- if you want to sleep a bit more you can close the >Rollos< again and set the awake-time new
- if you don´t fill beer but tea into the >Behälter< you can know what temperature is has and put the tea to the correct temperature in

### Entertainment:
- who can drink the most?
- who can drink the fastest?
- if you make a movie-day and you stay all day in your bed
