### I worked on: contra
- apps too big for servers, no single subsystem fit on the server
- high performance is not guaranteed if you glue individual technologies (scalable) together
- no developers - built a system with 100 000 000 useres?
- lack of control over the environment in which you creation is deplayed
- software which is insufficient -> allwo errors to enter and spread through the system -> poor user experience
- users could not be stopped to use there devices
- security is a big problem
- quick growth of IoT endpoints

### IoT Discussion

- Automation of daily life
- Easily access information
- IoT is new and difficult to develop
- 700 different possible devices for one scenario
- If you properly setup devices, you can even be woken up by a toaster.
- Personal data is saved and needs to be protected
- IoT devices can be abused (e.g. fire alarm as morning alarm)

- Example: Guy in huge company was able to control whole building
- Also: nuclear weapons can be a potential risk
	-> Additional security measures

- New jobs
- Loosing jobs
- e.g. gas station

- No system is 100% secure
- Time & Costs
- Cisco provides certifications for security mechanisms

- Is it possible to enable secure embeded systems?
- Question about waranty and legal rights?
- What happens when a malfunctioning device causes damage?

- Environmental impact?
- No argument against IoT
- Poor people are exploited anyway
- Software is expensive
