### Contra
- apps too big for servers, no single subsystem fit on the server
- high performance is not guaranteed if you glue individual technologies (scalable) together
- developers - built a system with 100 000 000 useres?
- lack of control over the environment in which you creation is deplayed
- software which is insufficient -> allwo errors to enter and spread through the system -> poor user experience
- users could not be stopped to use there devices
- security is a big problem
- quick growth of IoT endpoints
