  Folie 4 - Who are you?
    What type of programming experience?
      Only what I have learned from FH.
      I have experience in Java, C++ and Swift.

    What have you done with micro controllers? (Like Arduino, ESP8266, Photon)
      Wie only worked with micro controller in MDT and HNP in Hagenberg.

    Single board Computers (Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi, Beaglebone)
      None of the mentioned.
      But in MDT and HNP in Hagenberg, we have worked with two different micro controller.

    Who is a maker or part of a maker community?
      No I did not even know what that is.

    What do you already know about IoT?
      I did not know anything but of those things my father told me.
      We have Loxone in our House.

    What are your expectations from this class?
      I want learn about IoT.
      I want to learn how to create and build IoT-Systems.

  Folie 14 - IoT
  Worked with Kevin Pirklbauer;

    What does the Internet of Things entail?
      ???

    Use laptop to google about IoT, find and note down including small description (submit as participation proof at end of class):
      - 3 domains (included areas)
        E-Commerce, Smart Homes/ Objects, Transportation, Wearables, Agriculture
      - 2 commonly used (data) protocols
        CoAP = Constraint Application Protocoll based on Rest for embedded system, NFC
      - 2 typical devices (appliance or controller)
        Smart Door Locks, Waschmaschine, Trockner, Geschirrspüler

  Video:
  Worked with Kevin Pirklbauer und Johannes Lugstein;

    Domains:
      - Wohnraumgestaltung
      - Brettspiele
      - Smart cities
      - autonome Autos

    Benefits:
      - Knowlege is power
      - Conn. everything
      - Tracking
      - Health care
      - Data has value
      - Overview over all your devices

    Challenges:
      - big data
      - different typs of devices
      - Connenctivity:
        --> Security-Problems
        --> Privacy-Problems
      - prediction:
        --> you can´t predict the future
        --> you can´t predict the development
        --> difficult to develop
      - Battery live
      - complex
        --> Set up
      - billion devices
      - Connectivity:
        --> Growth bigger than progress
      - Who pays?
        --> multiple Company
      - not 1 but many conn. per person
      - migration from newer Devices
      - no Standards
