## Folie 2 - Exchange Formats: How to speak IoT?
### Yaml:
- YAML was said to mean Yet Another Markup Language
- human-readable data serialization language
- angelegt an XML und an die Sprachen Perl, Python, C and RFC2822
- used for applications where data is being stored
- offers an "in-line" style for denoting associative arrays and lists --> similar to JSON
![YAML](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rnC8H.png)

### Binary:
- compact representations for XML (Extensible Markup Language)
- reducing the cost of parsing
- used for applications where the performance of standard XML is insufficient
- usability challenges the user
- Not readable

### XML: (= Extensible Markup Language)
- rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable

#### !!! andere machen (Binary[CBOR], Text, XML[SOAP], JSON, YAML)

#### costs
- ?

### IIC (= Industrial Internet Consortium)
#### members
- Intel, IBM, GE, Cisco, AT&T (founded in 2014) and Bosch, Huawei, SAP

#### Purpose
- setting the architectural framework for industrial IoT - making it easier to adopt interconnected machines and intelligent analysis.

#### Cost
- from $2500 to $150.000 in six levels of membership

## Folie 7 - Protocols
### CoAP (= Constrained Application Protocol)
- Data is send via UDP or a UDP analogue
- specialized Internet Application Protocol
- defined in RFC 7228
- designed for use between devices on the same constrained network (e.g., low-power, lossy networks)
- between devices and general nodes on the Internet
- and between devices on different constrained networks both joined by an internet
-  service layer protocol that is intended for use in resource-constrained internet devices
- can be used easily translate to HTTP for simplified integration with the web
- IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks
- high packet error rates
- typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s
- latency is much smaller than MQTT AND HTTP
- Overhead and parsing complexity.
- URI and content-type support.
- Support for the discovery of resources provided by known CoAP services.
- Simple subscription for a resource, and resulting push notifications.
- Simple caching based on max-age.
- many different Libraries and Languages
- a Server is needed
  - run on microcontroller
